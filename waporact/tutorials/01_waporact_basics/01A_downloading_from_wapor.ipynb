    "\n",
    "**Background info**: \n",
    "\n",
    "the class **WaporRetrieval** is built on top of (inherits) an edited version of the class **WaporAPI** originally written by Bich Tran at IHE Delft for the various open source WAPOR packages released by IHE DELFT. It is this class that allows access to the data on the wapor portal. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a great package for accessing the WAPOR data via API and if you want more flexibility in your implementation or if you want to dive into the code directly; I recommend you check out the original code available via their packages on GIT. You can also check out the edited version of their **WaporAPI** class that can be found in this package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Activating the class**:\n",
    "\n",
    "to intiate the class you need to enter/edit the following inputs below:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required Inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **waporact_directory**: path to the directory where the project specific directory will be created. the class *WaporRetrieval* automatically creates a new directory using the input *project_name* on activation and creates subfolders to organise the data as well. The functions that follow automatically use these folders.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- **shapefile_path**: the shapefile is a needed input that specifies the location to download data for as well as the projection to output it in. Directly the input is the path to the shapefile itself. The function retrieves the data for the area(s) shown in the shapefile.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Note**: A shapefile is required and provides alot of the required info for the project including the extent and the output projection. Any projection (crs) is accepted, wapor data is always downloaded in epsg: 4326 and the shapefile bounding box is transformed as needed to match. If needed the retrieved data is transformed to match the original projection of the input shapefile if needed.<br><br>  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **wapor_level**: level of WAPOR data to download. There are 3 levels from low resolution 250m (1) and mid resolution 100m (2) to high resolution 30m (3). All of Africa and part of the middle east is available at level 1. Specific countries are available at level 2. Only some specific locations around the size of valleys or hydrosheds are available at level 3. For more info on the levels please see: https://wapor.apps.fao.org/home/WAPOR_2/1. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Note**: A spatial check is carried out on the download area specified in your shapefile to see if data is available for it at the given level when running (only level 1 and 3 spatial checks exist currently). Error messages provide details.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- **api_token**: the api token retrieved form the WAPOR site goes here. see the instructions above on how to retrieve a token from the WAPOR website.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **period_start**: date you want to start your data download from, enter as a datetime object. This can be provided again later in other functions overwriting the stored period_start.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- **period_end**: date you want to end your data download at, enter as a datetime object.This can be provided again later in other functions overwriting the stored period_end. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **datetime objects**: A specific way of formatting dates for python. It is made up of the function datetime followed by the date in brackets split into the sections: Year (4 digits), month (2 or 1 digit), day (2 or 1 digits). (google python datetime object for more details)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "        - *Example*: November 4th 2020 or 4-11-2020: datetime(2020,11,4)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "        - *Note*: do not use leading zeros for single digit dates (1 not 01).<br><br>  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional Inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following inputs are optional and have default values. They can also be provided later when running the class functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **project_name**: name of the directory that will be created, all data retrieved and analysed can be found in here, auto set to *test* if not provided.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- **return_period**: return period to download data for, given as a single letter code. available periods include: I: Daily, D: Dekadal, S: Seasonal, A: Annual (yearly). This can also be provided later when running the class functions. Auto sets to the Dekadal (D) if not provided.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- **silent**: boolean option automatically set to False. If set to True the more general messages shared with the user when running the class will be turned off.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Note**: class arguments period_start, period_end and return_period are stored in the class and the user does not need to provide them anymore afterwards. If the argument is provided again while using a function (example: *download_wapor_rasters*) the argument stored in the class instance is replaced and the new version is used moving forward."
