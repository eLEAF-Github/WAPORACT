    "## Calculating Performance Assessment Indicators (PAIs)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Introduction\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The 01 notebooks guide users through the basics on how to download data from the wapor portal using the class **WaporRetrieval**, how to calculate statistics using the retrieved files and plot them.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The goal of the 02 notebooks is to show an example of how the functionsavailable in the waporact package can be combined into a function or a pipeline to achieve a specific result. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In *02A_step_by_step_yield_calculation* we showed you how to use the waporact functions to calculate yield and water productivity as well as an example of how to do it all in one function.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this notebook we provide an example of a full pipeline that can be used to calculate Performance Assessment Indicators (PAIs). In this pipeline the classes and functions from the waporact package have been organized into a new class *WaporPAI* with the specific purpose of calculating PAIs. <br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Performance Assessment Indicators: PAI's are statistics that have been developed specifically to provide information on agricultural productivity and water use effeciency from information taken from sattelite imagery.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Pipeline Defintion: a pipeline is a set of steps carried out one after the other in order to achieve a specific result. It is a process that is also often automated as the steps are standardised allowing for quick and repeated use. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Performance Assessment Indicators (PAIs) in detail\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Increasing competition for and limited availability of water and land resources puts a serious constraint on agricultural production systems. Sustainable land and water management practices will be critical to expand production efficiently and address food insecurity while limiting impact on the ecosystem. This requires a good understanding of how agricultural systems are performing and their potential for improvement. Variables affecting the performance of agricultural systems are both biophysical (climate, soil, topography) and socio-ecological (market, infrastructure, farm management, available inputs). The proposed approach is built on performance assessment indicators that look at satellite observations of the actual crop production and water consumption from the WaPOR database. The indicators focus on the actual performance of the agriculture system and the underlying biophysical factors, but as a satellite-based system it cannot provide information on underlying socio-ecological variables.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The approach is based on a number of Performance Assessment Indicators (PAIs) that are derived from FAO WaPOR data on crop, water consumption and growth. The indicators estimate Water Productivity (WP) and Land Productivity (yield) perfomances at various levels for specific crop types for a selected area and time period. \r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "the class **WaporPAI** is used to calculate performance indicators for areas specified using a shapefile. To allow access to the wapor data it uses (inherits) **WaporRetrieval** the class that allows access to the wapor portal in the waporact package.<br> \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- NOTE: **WaporRetrieval** itself is built on top of (inherits) the class **WaporAPI** originally written by Bich Tran at IHE Delft for the various open source WAPOR packages released by IHE DELFT. It is a great package for accessing the WAPOR data via API and if you want more flexibility in your implementation or if you want to dive into the code directly; I recommend you check out the original code available via their packages on GIT. You can also check out the edited version of their **WaporAPI** class that can be found in this package.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Activating the class**:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "to intiate the class you need to enter/edit the following inputs below:<br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- NOTE: Initiation of **WaporPAI** is exactly the same as **WaporRetrieval**.<br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Required Inputs:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **waporact_directory**: path to the directory where the project specific directory will be created. the class *WaporRetrieval* automatically creates a new directory using the input *project_name* on activation and creates subfolders to organise the data as well. The functions that follow automatically use these folders.<br><br> \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **shapefile_path**: the shapefile is a needed input that specifies the location to download data for as well as the projection to output it in. Directly the input is the path to the shapefile itself. The function retrieves the data for the area(s) shown in the shapefile.<br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "    - **Note**: A shapefile is required and provides alot of the required info for the project including the extent and the output projection. Any projection (crs) is accepted, wapor data is always downloaded in epsg: 4326 and the shapefile bounding box is transformed as needed to match. If needed the retrieved data is transformed to match the original projection of the input shapefile if needed.<br><br>  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **wapor_level**: level of WAPOR data to download. There are 3 levels from low resolution 250m (1) and mid resolution 100m (2) to high resolution 30m (3). All of Africa and part of the middle east is available at level 1. Specific countries are available at level 2.

    "\r\n",
    "- **api_token**: the api token retrieved form the WAPOR site goes here. see the instructions above on how to retrieve a token from the WAPOR website.<br><br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **period_start**: date you want to start your data download from, enter as a datetime object. This can be provided again later in other functions overwriting the stored period_start.<br><br> \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **period_end**: date you want to end your data download at, enter as a datetime object.This can be provided again later in other functions overwriting the stored period_end. <br><br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "    - **datetime objects**: A specific way of formatting dates for python. It is made up of the function datetime followed by the date in brackets split into the sections: Year (4 digits), month (2 or 1 digit), day (2 or 1 digits). (google python datetime object for more details)<br>\r\n",
